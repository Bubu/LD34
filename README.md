## Button Sniper ##
Made by Stephan WÃ¤ldchen & Marcus Hoffmann for [Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=11335)
The game is programmed using the [libGDX framework](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and uses some things from their default UI skin.
Graphics made in Inkscape & Gimp.
Sounds made with sfxr.

### Notes ###
Gameplay is easy, just like in real world button sniping. Your mouse is represented by a blue button and the projectile by a red button at the bottom of the page.
Just klick down the blue button over the red button and drag it down over the edge. The red button will be flipped in the opposite direction.

Use your buttons to deactivate the laser security system in various levels. Pay attention to the surroundings and use them to your advantage.
Esc for menu. R for reload.

If the web version is too slow use the download version (requires java).
There is one nasty bug: When you pause the game, all of the moving platforms get completely out of sync. Just reset the level then.

### Story ###
Years have passed since Jimmy Two-Button was last called to his job. Times have been easy ...
But now, as the tides rise again and calamity ascends from the deep, his skills are needed once more.
Only one man and his unusual weapons stand between our world and the darkness.

Are you ready to take on the role of Jimmy Two-Button --- the worlds best button sniper?

### To Do: ###
Better level design, more difficult levels, more levels, additional dialogue (only four dialogues so far).
All our timers are broken if you pause the game (or it loses focus, or it runs slower than expected...)
